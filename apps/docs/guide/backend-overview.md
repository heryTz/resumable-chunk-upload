## Implement Your Own

To integrate the Resumable Chunk Upload backend, you need to handle two routes: one for retrieving the latest upload status and another for uploading the chunks.

Here is the [OpenAPI documentation](https://github.com/heryTz/resumable-chunk-upload/blob/main/api.yaml) that provides guidance on integrating these two APIs.

::: tip
Feel free to choose any path names for these routes.
